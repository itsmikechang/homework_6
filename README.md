Weather Dashboard

## Description
- I want to create a weather app that allows me to view a current/five day forecast of the location that I put in.
- I should allow me to save the cities that I have searched for and be able to click on them to search them again.
- The app should show me date, temp, humidity, uv index, and wind speed.
